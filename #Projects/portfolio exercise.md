# Portfolio

Lets create a portfolio

I would encourage you to use this portfolio as your actual portfolio that you can show interested employeers.

The text you write in the portfolio does not matter for this assignment



## HTML

I want **at least** these tags in the portfolio! 

- Head
  - Title
- Header
  - Nav
- Main
- Section
- Footer
- Img
- Ul or Ol



## Sections

Please add these different section

- Introduction that describes yourself
- List of educations
- List of jobs
- A footer with contact information
- List of projects

To check the html of some website:

- Right click on the mouse and go to `inspect elements`. 
- On safari you need to enable it. Google something like `safari inspect elements`.  



### HTML checklist

- [ ] Are the class names and idâ€™s semantic and do they describe the content of the tag?
- [ ] Has idâ€™s and class names been used correctly.
- [ ] Has the correct tag been used. Fx is main, header, footer, section, nav used properly.
- [ ] Is the html correctly implemented. 
- [ ] Are there unnecessary wrappers?
- [ ] Has kebab-case been used? `product-list`
- [ ] Has alt attributes been written for `img` tags?



### CSS checklist

- [ ] Is the css imported using the style tag.
- [ ] Are there unused selectors.
- [ ] Are there lots of fixed pixel values. This could affect responsive layouts.
- [ ] Try to avoid absolute positioning as this tends to break responsive layouts.
- [ ] Use flexbox over floats.
- [ ] Avoid using `!important` statements.
- [ ] Avoid inline styles
- [ ] Consistent naming and grouping of css-classes (see naming conventions below)
- [ ] CSS selectors are only as specific as they need to be



### Deploy your website to the web

- Create a new repository on GitHub. 
- Add your `index.html` to that repo. 
- Go to `settings` for that repo. 
- Scroll down to where it says `GitHub Pages`. 
- Where it says `source`, select `master` and then save. 
- If you scroll back down you can see the url for your new portfolio! it should be called `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/    `
- Here is an example of the code for my github portfolio: https://github.com/benna100/portfolio (you only need the `.html` and the `.css` file)

Everytime you push changes to `master` your website will be updated!



## Handing in the porfolio

Hand in the portfolio using the GitHub pages link in this format: `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/`

Here is the example of my portfolio: https://benna100.github.io/portfolio/
