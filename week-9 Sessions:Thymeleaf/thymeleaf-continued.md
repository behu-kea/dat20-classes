# Thymeleaf continued

Last week we familarized ourselves with Thymeleaf. We can use Thymeleaf for more advanced scenarios that we will be looking at today.



Social media assignement to next week. Sorry for late notice. Not mandatory. 



## Why are we even continuing talking about Thymeleaf

Thymeleaf is a powerful system and can do things like fragments, translation, and logic. This can be super useful when developing a site.



## Learning goals

- More advanced thymeleaf syntax
- Thymeleaf fragments
- Iterating a list of objects



## Thymeleaf syntax

There is quite a bit of detail in the Thymeleaf syntax. I will be talking about a few of them: https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html#standard-expression-syntax



### If

https://www.baeldung.com/spring-thymeleaf-conditionals

```html
<td>
    <span th:if="${teacher.gender == 'F'}">Female</span>
    <span th:unless="${teacher.gender == 'F'}">Male</span>
</td>
```



### Switch

https://www.baeldung.com/spring-thymeleaf-conditionals

```html
<td th:switch="${numberOfCourses}">
    <span th:case="'0'">NO COURSES YET!</span>
    <span th:case="'1'" >A course</span>
</td>
```



### Link url's

https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/standardurlsyntax.html

Relative to where the app is deployed it will give the correct url. So if running localhost the link will look like this: `http://localhost:8080/lol`

```html
<a th:href="@{/product}">product</a>
```



### Literal substitutions

```html
<span th:text="|Welcome to our application, ${user.name}!|"></span>
```





### Exercise - Working with if, switch and link - level 1 30 min

Create a new endpoint and a new template file for these exercises. You can just work in a new porject or in the social media site thats up to you. The following exercises does not have anything to do with social media exercises



#### If

Send a `boolean` variable from the controller to the view. The variable should be called `isUserLoggedIn`. If the variable is `true` then render a `p` tag saying `Welcome back`. If it is `false` render a `p` tag saying `Please log in`



#### Switch

Send a variable called `userType` from the controller to the view. 

- If `userType` is equal to `free` render a `p` tag with the text `Consider paying`
- If `userType` is equal to `paying` render a `p` tag with the text `Consider upgrading to premium`
- If `userType` is equal to `premium` render a `p` tag with the text ` We hope you are happy with your account`



### Link

Make a link to an endpoint using the link syntax shown above. 





## Fragments

On a standard website we probably have about 30 html pages. Imagine that you get the task to change the logo image in the header. Imaging going to every single one of those pages looking for the logo image, rewriting the image `src` but probably also the `alt` attribute. That would be quite a task and what if you forgot that one hidden page? Now you have the old logo showing to customers (this is something the author have literally done so its not even a thought up example ðŸ˜†)

For exactly that reason we use fragments.



### What is fragments

Fragments is a way to reuse html on different pages. You could fx create a header fragment with the logo and the navigation links. Now when you create a new page, you simply use the Header fragment in that page. 



### Practical example

Lets add a `header` to another page

`src/main/resources/templates/fragments/header.html`

```html
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
  <header>
  	<a href="/">
    	<img src="/logo.png" alt="Company logo" />
    </a>
    <nav>
    	<ul>
        <li><a href="home">Home</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
</html>
```



`src/main/resources/templates/product.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlnd="http://thymeleaf.org">
	<header th:replace="fragments/header.html"></header>
  <body>
    <h1>Product page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```



### Fragment Parameters

Imagine you have a site where each page has a unique title! How do you solve that without creating a `head` tag for each individual page? Fragment Parameters is the answer 

You can pass in parameters to your fragment! And it's nearly like just calling a method

`fragments/header.html`

```html
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
  <header>
  	<a href="/">
    	<img src="/logo.png" alt="Company logo" />
    </a>
    <p th:text="${currentPage}"></p>
    <nav>
    	<ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
</html>
```



```html
<header th:replace="fragments/header.html(currentPage='home')"></header>
```



## Resources folder structure

*Not part of learning goals!*

The resources holds as the name tells resources for the spring application. These can be thought of as frontend resources like html files, css files, javascript files etc.

- `static` - Has all the static files (files that dont change) for the web application. This is `css` files, `js` files, `images` and more
  - `images` - A folder i have chosen to create. Contains images
  - `styling` - A folder i have chosen to create contains css files.
- `templates` - Contains the html for the different pages in your application. Think `about`, `dashboard`, `contact` etc.
  - `frgaments` - Contains the fragments for the application

### Exercises

Continuing the social media exercise:



### `footer` - level 1

Create a new fragment called `footer.html`. You can see the `footer` here where it says `developed by Benjamin`ðŸ‘‡

Add this `footer` fragment to your `/dashboard` page



![dashboard](./../week-8/assets/dashboard.png)



*If you have not created a page for the `/dashboard` endpoint use the code below*

In your Controller

```java
@GetMapping("/dashboard")
public String renderEventForm() {
    return "dashboard.html";
}
```

**`src/main/resources/templates/dashboard.html`**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Dashboard</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Welcome to your Dashboard</h1>
  <!--
	This is where the footer fragment should go!
	-->
	</body>
</html>
```



Now you need to figure out how to add the `footer` fragment to the dashboard page 



### `head` - level 2

Lets create the `head` tag as a fragment for our social media site

We have 3 pages on our site (for this example we call it  `Social Media Star`): `/dashboard`, `/submit` and `/success`. When going to the 

- `/dashboard` the title should of the page should be `Social Media Star - Dashboard ðŸ“ˆ`
- `/submit`, the title should of the page should be `Social Media Star - Create new post ðŸ’Œ`
- `/success`, the title should of the page should be `Social Media Star - Success ðŸŽ‰`

To create a seperate title for each fragment we have to use fragment parameters!

Off course you need to add the other things in your `head` tag that you already had there. Like fx the `link` tag for the css, `meta` tag and what you now have there.

If you have not created the success page, just create the endpoint and the template file like we did with the dashboard!



### `Header` - level 3

The `header` fragment should have a parameter called `currentPage`. The value of `currentPage` is the url of the page you are currently on. That could fx be `dashboard`, `submit`, `success`, etc. In the navigation part of the `header` the current page should be highlighted (maybe with bold text or some other background color) Like seen in the screenshot below. The current page is highlighted with a green `background-color`



![Screenshot 2021-02-17 at 11.25.37](./assets/highlighted-navigation.png)



 You will probably need to change a class somehow ðŸ‘‡



#### Changing class of an element

```html
<a href="" class="baseclass" th:classappend="${isAdmin} ? adminclass : userclass"></a>
```

If `isAdmin` is `true`, then this will result in

```html
<a href="" class="baseclass adminclass"></a>
```
